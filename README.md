# UCSD Data Visualization Project 1 - COVID in Los Angeles

The following project of data analysis was compiled between:
Spencer Broberg,
Everardo Maya,
Ivan Montelongo,
Sam Van de Velde.

Our project will utlize the data from a variety of sources like the LA Times, the EPA and other sources to calculate the COVID infection rates
within the Los Angeles greater area. The team will use housing data, air quality, travel and people's compliance in social distancing to confirm 
which factors were the most influential at raising the number of infected people. 

While we have been informed through media and other reports on how the U.S. has been affected by the novel corona virus, the team aims to validate
the information by peparing data driven graphical representations to support our understanding and common beliefs on infection. 

Among the impacting variables compiled, we will be reviewing:

1.	Passenger volume of inbound flights
2.	Median income per district/poverty rate
3.	Crime rate
4.	Air pollution
5.	Vaccine doses administered
6.	Demographics (age/race/gender)
7.	ZIP code
